        /// - [Instructor] Here is sample interview question number four with two dimensional array and time complexity. 
        /// Here's the problem. You're given a two dimensional array with integers which is square shaped which means 
        /// that the number of rules is equal to the number of columns, and this array has a special property that each 
        /// row and each column is sorted. So, if you look at each column from top to bottom, the integers always increase or stay the same. 
        /// If you look at each row from left to right the integers always increase or stay the same, 
        /// and I want you to write a function that takes this 2D array as the input and returns the number of negative numbers in it.
        /// 
        /// So, for instance, for this array we should return six because there are six negative numbers.
        /// First, try finding a big O of N squared solution.Then, try finding a more efficient solution with 
        /// linear time complexity or big O of N. For clarifying questions you might ask is the 2D array always square shaped? 
        /// Yes, as I said earlier, the number of columns is equal to the number of rows. What about zero? Zero 
        /// is not counted as a negative number.
        /// 
        /// As usual, try solving this problem and make sure to run your code.
