        /// - [Narrator] Here's a quick overview of two-dimensional array. 
        /// Two dimensional arrays are often used in coding interviews, so let's examine how it works. 
        /// Conceptually, a two-dimensional array is a collection of items, for example, a collection of numbers, 
        /// that's laid out in a two-dimensional table. For example, this table on the screen has two rows and four 
        /// columns with the items, one, three, nine, four, five, zero, eight, and negative three. 
        /// A two-dimensional array like this one is usually implemented as an array of arrays.
        ///
        /// So this two-dimensional array would be typically represented as an array of two arrays, 
        /// the first one containing the first row, one, three, nine, four, and the second array containing the second row, 
        /// five, zero, eight, and negative three.One common assumption here is that a two-dimensional array has a rectangular shape. 
        /// What that means is, each row has the same number of items as all the other rows. You might want to clarify this by asking 
        /// something like, "can we assume that each row has the same number of items?" 
        ///
